    "story_text": "Tommy had a shiny green shell that he loved. But one day, some rabbit friends laughed at him.\n\n'Your shell is so weird!' 'Why are you so slow?' 'Ha ha, Tommy the slowpoke!'\n\nThe words hurt Tommy's heart. He went inside his shell and didn't come out for days. Even his shiny shell looked dull and sad.\n\nGrandpa Turtle came to talk to him. 'What's wrong, Tommy?'\n\nTommy told him what the rabbits said. 'Their words hurt so much.'\n\n'Words are very powerful,' Grandpa said. 'Mean words can hurt like a wound. But kind words can heal like medicine.'\n\nGrandpa helped Tommy come out of his shell. 'You are brave. You are special. Your shell is beautiful.'\n\nWith each kind word, Tommy felt a little better. His shell started to shine again.\n\nLater, the rabbits came back. They saw how sad Tommy had been.\n\n'We're sorry, Tommy,' they said. 'We didn't know words could hurt so much.'\n\n'That's okay,' Tommy said. 'Now we all know. Let's only use kind words from now on.'\n\nThey made a promise. And Tommy's shell shone brighter than ever.",
